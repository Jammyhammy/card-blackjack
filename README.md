card-blackjack
==============

A ruby script written in ruby 2.0.0 that's a simple blackjack card game. Pretty self-explanatory and is to be executed in the cmdline with "ruby cardgame.rb"

Some features I'd like to add/change:
- Change the code of player, card, and add in a deck class so we can play different card games
- Some refactoring for the nested conditional statements in the Blackjack class
- The dealer is extremely easy to beat. Up the difficulty by swapping cards.
- Refactor out some of the nested if else conditional statements, for most of these it's possible to write better ruby code.
